**Before submitting:**
- [ ] I have searched existing issues to ensure this example hasn't already been requested
- [ ] I have checked the [demo source code](https://github.com/jbcom/strata/tree/main/docs/demos) for existing examples

**What example would you like to see?**
Describe the example, demo, or tutorial you'd like added.

**Use case**
What would this example help you or others accomplish?

**Which Strata presets should be demonstrated?**

*Background Layer:*
- [ ] Sky (procedural sky with time-of-day and weather)
- [ ] Volumetrics (volumetric fog, god rays, underwater effects)
- [ ] Terrain (SDF-based terrain generation)
- [ ] MarchingCubes (mesh generation from SDFs)

*Midground Layer:*
- [ ] Water (advanced water rendering with reflections/refractions)
- [ ] Vegetation (GPU-instanced grass, trees, rocks)
- [ ] Raymarching (GPU-accelerated SDF rendering)

*Foreground Layer:*
- [ ] Character (articulated character system)
- [ ] Fur (shell-based fur rendering)
- [ ] Molecular (molecular structure visualization)

*Multi-Preset Examples:*
- [ ] Full scene (combining multiple presets from different layers)
- [ ] Preset interaction (e.g., Volumetrics with Water for underwater effects)

- [ ] Other: [specify]

**Complexity level**
- [ ] Basic (single preset, minimal setup)
- [ ] Intermediate (multiple presets, custom configuration)
- [ ] Advanced (full scene, performance optimization, custom shaders)
